# Expert_System_of_Integrated_Circuits_Series-74XX
An expert system is software that uses a database of expert knowledge. The role of expert systems is to offer advice or make decisions with the help of collected expert knowledge. Expert systems can be used in a variety of fields, such as medicine, administration, science, computing, and many other fields. The expert integrated circuit system of the 74xx series is intended for students involved in computer electronics. The expert system provides useful information for users who deal with integrated circuits but do not have enough experience or have not dealt with the topic for a while. This expert system contains only combination circuits of the 74xx series.

The project contains program installation as well as its own documentation. The program might not work properly on some PCs. Program code can be viewed in this repository. The program is written in the Object Pascal programming language.

The documentation contains a user guide for installation and program use as well as a detailed project description.

Expert System contains its own base of knowledge with over 250 intagrated circuits and over 400 images of logic and pinauts, hand-collected from various data sheets available on the web.

The documentation was originally written in Serbian as part of a student project presentation, so the translated version may contain some errors.
